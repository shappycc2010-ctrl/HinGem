# Hingem — Prototype Package

This ZIP contains a prototype skeleton for the Hingem AI homepage and supporting files.

Files included:
- index.html          — Single-file prototype (front page animation + homepage).
- logo.svg            — Simple black diamond SVG with sparkles.
- system_prompt.json  — System prompt JSON for LLM orchestration.
- architecture.md     — App architecture notes and MVP roadmap.
- README.md           — This file.

How to use:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open index.html in a modern browser to view the front-page animation and homepage prototype.
3. Replace the voice-button prototype (prompt()) with your Web Speech / STT + TTS integration.
4. Use system_prompt.json as the base system prompt in your LLM orchestration layer. Implement the 'dfgrty666.' shutdown behavior in your API gateway/session management.

Enjoy! — Shappy / Hingem team
